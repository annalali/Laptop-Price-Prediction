The **(COVID19)** pandemic came to consolidate the concept of the importance of technology, including computers, laptops, tablets and mobile phones of all kinds; One of the most important changes that resulted from the pandemic for nearly two years is the change in the method of education, which has become and is still online.
As peopleâ€™s awareness of acquiring devices has become great in terms of the importance of specifications, and we are witnessing in this period from March 16, 2020 to the present time, where every home has 2 to 4 computers or tablets, because of its importance in following virtual classes, work and transactions government and others.

That is why we wanted to shed light on computers through their prices, specifications and brands. And we aim in our project to do several things, **including:**

- **First:** Choosing a suitable dataset for business.
- **Second:** Analysis of this data through EDA.
- **Third:** Building a Machine Learning model to predict the price of computers through regression model.

Linear regression is one of models machine learning-supervised learning.
What is meant by linear regression? Linear regression aims at finding a linear relationship between two continuous variables. By searching for an statistical relationship but not a deterministic relationship.

These two variables represented One is predictor or independent variable and other is response or dependent variable. In a clearer sense,  linear regression aims at finding a linear relationship between target and one or more predictors.
It can be used in many areas, including: Stock-market prediction, demand forecasting, price estimation, ad bid optimization, risk management, asset management, weather forecasting, sports prediction.
Regression: Predict the real-valued output for each individual, based on input data.
